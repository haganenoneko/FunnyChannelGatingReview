# FunnyChannelGatingReview
Supplementary figures and code for the review "Analysis of voltage-dependent gating of funny channels by kinetic models"

Notes and figures for model parameterization (.\A_model parameterization.md) and model optimization (.\B_model optimization.md) are available here. These discuss how the modelling in Figure 2 of the main text was done, including how the data were digitized, how the differential equations were set up and solved, and how the models were calibrated. Note that, although these are Markdown (.md) files, they may not view well (especially the equations) in the GIthub browser. One platform that can view these files well (after downloading both the .md files and images into the same directory) is Typora, which is available for free at https://typora.io/.

'additional fitting results for wt and mutant with four state model.docx' shows simulations for the wild-type and depolarization-activated mutant under different conditions, such as without detailed balance, fitting only the activating step of the protocol, or the conditions shown in Figure 2 of the main text.
