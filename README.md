# FunnyChannelGatingReview
Update (July 22, 2021): Code will be uploaded shortly (within a week or so) after resolving some logistic issues. 

Supplementary figures and code for the review "Analysis of voltage-dependent gating of funny channels by kinetic models"

Notes and figures for model parameterization (.\A_model parameterization.md) and model optimization (.\B_model optimization.md) are available here. 

'additional fitting results for wt and mutant with four state model.docx' shows simulations for the wild-type and depolarization-activated mutant under different conditions, such as without detailed balance, fitting only the activating step of the protocol, or the conditions shown in Figure 2 of the main text.
